----Averaging----

Comments/Issues:

-In documentation for Instant_insta you could talk about how the first picture made, appears to be just a combination of all the images used (6 images).
-You could then go on to say that this explains why when 50 images were used (actually around 44) the generated image doesn't appear to show anything. As 
	it's pretty much just image over image 50 times over.
-Another issue is that people use tags that don't even appear in the image. Either because they are trying to get more likes or because their image is
	indirectly related to that topic.
-White and black seem to be the steady-state values. 
	-Is there a way to avoid this without defaulting to some other value?

Solutions:

-Waiting on solution to the last point above (give me ideas pls)
-Using google images instead of Instagram
-Using images that are more likely to have the tag in the image
	-Achieved by reading their caption and seeing if the tag is the main tag.
		-or check to see if the search tag is a subset of the other tags or the other tags contain subsets of the search tag
		-eg when searching for sunset you might find #sun or #sunset_photo
		-if hashtags with sunset (or subset as described above) > other unrelated hashtags then use image
-Feature identification through deep learning/neural networks


----Unsupervised learning----

If it turns out that it's near impossible to use google images it would be better to use an unsupervised learning algorithm to determine
whether an image is okay to use or not.

Features:
	-Number of tags (check comments for tags too)
	-Number of tags related to topic
	-Number of times topic is mentioned in caption and/or comments
	-Is there different common theme? (eg: lots of tags with the word mountain in them)
(The above probably won't work. It seems that captions don't have any meaning when it comes to the contents of the image)
	-Not sure about these yet but just ideas:
		-Most common colour in image
		-range of colours in images
		-Don't think we need all the pixels (too computationally expensive)

RGB to single colour value:
	-Use a tree such that for R there are n ranges of values then at G there are the same etc.
	-and the leaf there is the colour value.
	-therefore n^3 leaf nodes
