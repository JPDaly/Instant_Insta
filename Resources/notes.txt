----Averaging----

Comments/Issues:

-In documentation for Instant_insta you could talk about how the first picture made, appears to be just a combination of all the images used (6 images).
-You could then go on to say that this explains why when 50 images were used (actually around 44) the generated image doesn't appear to show anything. As 
	it's pretty much just image over image 50 times over.
-Another issue is that people use tags that don't even appear in the image. Either because they are trying to get more likes or because their image is
	indirectly related to that topic.
-White and black seem to be the steady-state values. 
	-Is there a way to avoid this without defaulting to some other value?

Solutions:

-Waiting on solution to the last point above (give me ideas pls)
-Using google images instead of Instagram
-Using images that are more likely to have the tag in the image
	-Achieved by reading their caption and seeing if the tag is the main tag.
		-or check to see if the search tag is a subset of the other tags or the other tags contain subsets of the search tag
		-eg when searching for sunset you might find #sun or #sunset_photo
		-if hashtags with sunset (or subset as described above) > other unrelated hashtags then use image
-Feature identification through deep learning/neural networks
