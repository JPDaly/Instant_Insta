# Instant_Insta
Instant_Insta will automatically update your Instagram account based on a hashtag.

This branch implements a basic k-nearest neighbour method to create images from the scraped images.
It simply takes the average of all the images' pixels and creates a new image using these values.
As you will see the images are of poor quality and it is impossible (in most cases) to tell what they are supposed to represent.

Note:
This program relies on the use of a webdriver. I've chosen to use Chromedriver (which can be downloaded at "http://chromedriver.chromium.org/") however, I believe there are others. Chromedriver can be found in Resources\chromedriver.exe.
I'm assuming that it's okay to use chromedriver in this way and to include it in my repository because it's open source.
