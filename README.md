Note:
This program relies on the use of a webdriver. I've chosen to use Chromedriver (which can be downloaded at "http://chromedriver.chromium.org/") however, I believe there are others. Chromedriver can be found in Resources\chromedriver.exe.
I'm assuming that it's okay to use chromedriver in this way and to include it in my repository because it's open source.
