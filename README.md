Note:
This program relies on the use of a webdriver. I've chosen to use Chromedriver (which can be downloaded at "http://chromedriver.chromium.org/") however, I believe there are others. For the time being I haven't included the driver in this repository because I don't know what the proper way to include other people's work is. I understand that it's open source but I want to make sure that I'm doing the right thing.

For the above reason you will have to download Chromedriver yourself and change the destination string found in the constants.py to the location that you downloaded it to.
